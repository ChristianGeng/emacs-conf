My adapation of  
https://github.com/chaoflow/.emacs.d

Original README: 

Be prepared for rebases.

Better take a look at:

- https://github.com/corecode/skel/tree/master/.emacs.d
- https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d/
- https://github.com/cjohansen/.emacs.d
- https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit

from which I take inspiration or shamelessly copy.
