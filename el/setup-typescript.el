(provide 'setup-typescript)

;; TypeScript
;;
;; This is a basic configuration for the TypeScript language so that .ts files activate
;; typescript-mode when opened. Weâ€™re also adding a hook to typescript-mode-hook to call
;; lsp-deferred so that we activate lsp-mode to get LSP features every time we edit
;; TypeScript code.
;; Important note! For lsp-mode to work with TypeScript (and JavaScript) you will need to
;; install a language server on your machine. If you have Node.js installed, the easiest way
;; to do that is by running the following command:
;;
;; >> npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript
;;
;; This will install the typescript-language-server and the TypeScript compiler package.


(use-package typescript-mode
  :mode "\\.ts\\'"
  :hook (typescript-mode . lsp-deferred)
  :config
  (setq typescript-indent-level 2)
  )


(provide 'setup-typescript)
